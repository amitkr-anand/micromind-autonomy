I am explicitly locking the configuration for this stage in the text so future-you doesn’t accidentally regress it.
 
📘 MicroMind Autonomy – Daily Progress Log
Error-State EKF + INS Mechanisation Baseline (LOCKED)
Date: 04 Jan 2026
Stage: Foundational Autonomy Models (Pre-PX4)
Status: ✅ WORKING & LOCKED
 
1. Objective of Today’s Work
The goal for today was to establish and validate a clean, self-contained autonomy sandbox for MicroMind, independent of PX4 or any flight stack, in order to:
•	Prove core inertial navigation behaviour
•	Validate Error-State EKF (ESKF) propagation
•	Establish a canonical simulation entry-point
•	Create a repeatable reference baseline for future autonomy logic (NanoCortex, decision layers, GN
