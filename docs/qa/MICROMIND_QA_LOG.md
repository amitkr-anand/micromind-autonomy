## Entry QA-001 — 03 April 2026
**Session Type:** Onboarding / Architecture Review  
**Focus:** Programme context establishment, navigation architecture decision, project folder setup

**Findings:**
1. **[CRITICAL — OI-05]** `trn_stub.py` implies RADALT-NCC as production correction mechanism. Architecture decision taken 03 April to replace ingress correction with orthophoto image matching. Stub must be updated before fusion integration (S-NEP-04) to avoid incorrect implementation assumption being frozen into the ESKF interface.
2. **[HIGH — OI-04]** OpenVINS → ESKF interface not documented. Message format, covariance representation, and FM event handling protocol must be specified before S-NEP-04 code is written.
3. **[HIGH — OI-01]** STIM300 ARW 0.15°/√hr exceeds V7 spec floor of 0.1°/√hr. Spec must be updated to ≤ 0.2°/√hr before TASL meeting. Confirmed as S8 finding — not yet actioned in the spec document.
4. **[HIGH — OI-07]** OpenVINS Stage-2 GO verdict is indoor / short-sequence only (≤ 130 m). Km-scale and outdoor validation pending. This must be stated explicitly in any external-facing document referencing VIO performance.
5. **[MEDIUM — OI-06]** DMRL stub is rule-based. All BCMP-1 terminal guidance acceptance results (AT-2 through AT-5) are stub-based. Any report sent to TASL or external audience must include this caveat.

**Architecture Decision Recorded:**
- Navigation ingress correction: RADALT-NCC TRN → Orthophoto image matching (L2 Absolute Reset layer)
- RADALT retained for terminal phase only (0–300 m AGL, final 5 km)
- LWIR camera declared dual-use: orthophoto matching (ingress) + DMRL (terminal)
- Route planner terrain-texture cost term required (OI-08)

**Context File:** Created. Sections 1–10 populated.  
**Session Start Prompt:** Created.  
**Next Session:** Share milestone reports and ALS-250 overnight run results for QA review.
